1-Bit Emu is a collection of programs related to assembling and building software for the MC14500 1-bit microprocessor.

### __Basm__
Basm, or Bit Assembler, is an assembler for MC14500 programs and generally follows the same syntax as DASM.

### __Bemu__
Bemu, or Bit Emulator, is an emulator for the MC14500. It can run programs for the MC14500.

### __Ulog__
uLog is a helper library to enable simple logging for the two aformentions programs.

## Quick Start
To build all the programs run:

```
make all
```

from the root project directory. From there you will be able to run the assembler and emulator found in the bin folder.
